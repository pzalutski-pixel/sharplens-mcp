# Changelog

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- `sync_documents` infrastructure tool - Synchronize file changes from disk into the loaded solution
  - Faster than `load_solution` - only updates changed documents, doesn't re-parse projects
  - Handles modified files, new files, and deleted files
  - Supports specific file list or sync all documents
- Agent Responsibility documentation in README explaining sync workflow

### Changed
- Agents are now responsible for calling `sync_documents` after using Edit/Write tools
- SharpLensMcp refactoring tools continue to auto-update (no sync needed)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Relative paths by default - saves tokens in AI agent context (configurable via `SHARPLENS_ABSOLUTE_PATHS=true`)
- Cross-platform path normalization (forward slashes on all platforms)
- Platform-aware file path comparison (case-insensitive on Windows, case-sensitive on Linux/macOS)

### Changed
- All file paths now return relative to solution directory by default
- Paths use forward slashes consistently across Windows/Linux/macOS
- File lookups now match file system behavior on each platform

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- `get_method_source_batch` - Get source code for multiple methods in one call (reduces round trips when tracing code flows)
- `includeOutgoingCalls` parameter for `analyze_method` - Now returns what methods a method calls, not just who calls it
- AI Agent Configuration Tips section in README

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 57 to 58
- `analyze_method` now supports comprehensive method analysis in a single call (signature + callers + outgoing calls)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-27

### Changed
- Added Claude Code setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- Added configuration reference for all environment variables
- Added comparison table: SharpLensMcp vs native LSP capabilities

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- 10 new tools (47 → 57 total):
  - `get_code_actions_at_position` - List all available refactorings at position

  - `implement_missing_members` - Generate interface/abstract stubs
  - `encapsulate_field` - Convert field to property
  - `inline_variable` - Inline temporary variable
  - `extract_variable` - Extract expression to variable
